# EdgeDectection
A simple processing sketch for edge detection on sliced .STLs for SLA DLP 3D printing

This workflow is specifically for the Ember SLA DLP 3D printer. 
1.) Once you have an .STL prepped for printing, slice on www.emberprinter.com
2.) Download the tarball once your file has been sliced
3.) Extract the contents of the tarball and place in the "slices" folder of the sketch folder
4.) Run the sketch and your textured files should appear in output! This instructables can show you how to recreate the tarball:

5.) Once you've re-zipped, upload your .tar.gz file to your printer and you're ready to go!

This sketch is useful for creating textured surfaces on resin prints. Adding texture through edge detetection makes your file print like the swatch on the left below. The swatch on the right is a standard print.
